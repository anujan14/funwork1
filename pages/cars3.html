          <h4>Synopsis:</h4>

          <p align="justify">
            Lightning McQueen, now a seven-time Piston Cup racing legend, finds himself overshadowed by Jackson Storm, one of the next-generation rookie racers that use the latest technology to improve their racing performance. This causes McQueen's fellow veterans to either be retired or fired by their sponsors to make way for the new rookies. In the final race of the season, as he tries to catch up to Storm and the other leaders, his tire blows-out and he suffers a violent, nearly fatal rollover crash, leaving him badly injured, while Storm becomes the new Piston Cup Champion.

Four months later, while recovering in Radiator Springs, McQueen isolates himself from his friends, and spends his time watching footage of his late mentor, Doc Hudson. Despite McQueen's fears of being forced into retirement (as Doc was), Rusty and Dusty, the owners of McQueen's Rust-eze racing team, send him to a new state-of-the-art racing center, much to his surprise. When he arrives, he learns that they have sold Rust-eze to a new owner, Sterling, who assigns him to work with trainer Cruz Ramirez. McQueen eventually becomes impatient and annoyed with Cruz's methods, and attempts to use a high-tech racing simulator, only to cause severe damage to the equipment.<br><br>

Convinced that McQueen is no longer capable of winning, Sterling is ready to take him off the racing circuit, and use him for product endorsements. McQueen offers a deal instead – if McQueen wins the first race of the upcoming season in Florida, he can decide when he retires; otherwise, he will retire immediately. Sterling accepts the deal, but assigns Cruz to work with him one-on-one. Instead of improving his own top speed, McQueen spends most of the day helping Cruz get used to racing on the sandy coastline outside of the training center. For inspiration, they travel to a dirt track on which Doc raced in Thunder Hollow, but inadvertently end up competing in a demolition derby called "Crazy Eight", which Cruz ultimately wins, and her enthusiasm of winning inadvertedly leads to McQueen getting horribly embarrassed. Distraught at wasting his training time, McQueen rages at Cruz and, in a fit of frustration, accidentally breaks her trophy. Upset, Cruz reveals that she had wanted to race professionally just like McQueen all her life, but never started a race, because she felt outclassed. She resigns as McQueen's trainer, and starts back to the training center.

Learning that Storm has set a new lap record, McQueen calls his best friend, Mater, for advice. Mater suggests that he should track down Doc's mentor, Smokey. McQueen catches up to Cruz and, after revealing that he had fixed her trophy, convinces her to come along and the two travel to Doc's hometown of Thomasville, Georgia, where they meet Smokey and several of Doc's old friends. Smokey reveals that even though Doc never raced again after his crash, he found a new happiness in training McQueen. After Lightning McQueen accepts that he will never be as fast as Storm, Smokey and his friends teach McQueen and Cruz how to drive smarter than Storm, with Cruz serving as a sparring partner for Lightning. However, during a final practice race, Cruz suddenly overtakes McQueen and he has a flashback to his crash, shaking his confidence. <br><br>

At the race in Florida, McQueen is encouraged by Smokey and his friends, and gradually pushes up through the ranks. Still convinced McQueen cannot win, Sterling spots Cruz in the pits, and orders her to return to the racing centre to begin prepping another racer for the following week’s event, despite her wanting to stay and watch the race. McQueen overhears the exchange and remembers that Cruz had wanted to race because of him. He decides that Cruz is the answer to beating Storm. When a crash occurs, McQueen uses the opportunity to pit. Entering the pits, he has his pit crew outfit Cruz for racing, complete with his racing number and giving her the chance to finally race, against Sterling's wishes. Cruz uses McQueen’s coaching and Smokey’s advice to catch the leaders. Feeling threatened, Storm tries to intimidate Cruz, causing her to lose her confidence. When McQueen tells her that Storm tried to intimidate her because he was scared of her, she gains it back again. She later catches up to Storm and attempts to overtake him, but Storm pins her against the wall. She uses Doc's old trick and vaults over the wall, taking first place. After the race, Sterling tries to persuade her to race for him but she turns him down, accepting an offer from Tex Dinoco to race for his Dinoco racing team. When Sterling tells McQueen he needs him for a photo-shoot, the Jumbotron updates, also showing McQueen as the winner alongside Cruz, allowing him to decide whether he keeps racing. Tex Dinoco then goes to have a chat with Sterling.
<br><br>
Later, at an exhibition race in Radiator Springs, McQueen and Cruz reveal they have adopted Doc's old racing colors and number, respectively, to honor his memory. Tex Dinoco informs the group that he has bought Rust-eze from Sterling, and McQueen decides to continue racing and train Cruz as well.

In a post-credits scene, Mater, at his junkyard, tries to answer an incoming call from his phone. Somehow, he accidentally touches his reception antenna and his phone goes dead, much to his dismay.
